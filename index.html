    <h1>Theranos</h1>
    <hr>
    <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
    </h6>
    <p> <b>Theronas</b>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Englishs">(/ˈθɛrənoʊs/)</a>address was an American <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company">privately held technology</a> corporation.
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos#cite_note-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
     It was initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, with claims <br> of having devised <a href="link"> blood tests</a> that required only very small
      amounts of blood and could be performed very rapidly 
     using small automated devices the company had <br> developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false. <a href="link"><sup>[3][4][5] </sup></a> Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old <a href="link">Elizabeth Holmes
         ,</a> <a href="link"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
      Theranos raised more than <a href="link">US$</a>700 <br> million from venture capitalists and private investors, <a href="link"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
       a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014 <a href="link"><sup>[8][9]</sup></a>
     </p>

     <p>A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors <a href="link">John Ioannidis</a> and Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative
          journalist <a href="link">John Carreyrou</a> of <br> <a href="link">The Wall Street Journal,</a> questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string 
          of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, <br> investors, the <a href="link"> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC),<a href="link">Centers 
          for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS), state attorneys general, former business <br> partners, patients, and others. <a href="link"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
           June 2016,
           it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually <a href="link"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
        The <br> company was near <a href="link">bankruptcy</a> until it received, in 2017, a $100 million loan from <a href="link">Fortress Investment Group</a> secured by its patent. <a href="link"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
     </p>
     
     <p>In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <a href="link">CLIA</a> certificate and prohibition of Holmes and 
         other company officials from <br> owning or operating a laboratory for two years. <a href="link"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory
          operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical <br> testing machines. <a href="link"><sup>[14]</sup></a> In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a
           settlement agreement with CMS. <a href="link"> <sup>[15]</sup></a> Following the CMS sanctions, the <a href="link">Walgreens</a> pharmacy <br> chain terminated its contract with Theranos
            and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous <a href="link">breaches of contract.</a> The suit was <a href="link"> settled out of court,</a>with Theranos <br> compensating 
            Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer 
            went nowhere, what <br> remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. <a href="link"> <sup>[16]</sup></a>

    </p>

    <p>On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="link">Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani</a> were charged with "massive <a href="link">fraud"</a> by the 
        SEC. <a href="link"><sup>[17]</sup></a> One section <br> of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a
         thousand times more than the actual figure of <br> $100,000. <a href="link"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with 
         Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million <br> shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the
          company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any <a href="link">public company</a>for ten years. <a href="link"><sup>[19]</sup></a> According <br> to the agreement,
           if Theranos were acquired or otherwise <a href="link">liquidated,</a>Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was
            returned to <br> investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the 
            SEC's complaint. <a href="link"> <sup>[7]</sup></a> Balwani did not settle. <a href="link"><sup>[20]</sup></a> <br> On June 15, 2018, the <a href="link"> U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a> 
            announced the indictment of Holmes on <a href="link"> wire fraud</a> and conspiracy charges. Balwani was <br> also indicted on the same charges. <sup>[21]</sup>
             The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <a href="link"><sup>[22]</sup></a> but it has been delayed due to the <a href="link">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and <br> Holmes'
              pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021 <a href="link"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, while Balwani's trial has been postponed 
              until January 11, 2022. <a href="link"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
